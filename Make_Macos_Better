Apple has made macos really annoying. Like everytime I try to install app they verify etc. 
I don't need those as I am not the dumb user. And macos is such a gatekeeper. I tried to 
install ubuntu but all the driver isssue etc pulled me back. In fact Linux support is so 
poor. It seems I cannot fight like that. So the solution is just to disable every secure
related hoax in macos. I understand the implication so I am doing this. If you are not expert
in this field please don't try this.
